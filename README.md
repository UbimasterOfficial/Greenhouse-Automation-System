# Greenhouse-Automation-System
This project represents a __Greenhouse Automation IOT System__. Here, this code is used to check that the sensors are working correctly. Here, this code is written in C++, specifically using the Arduino framework. And I will mention below the components used here. <br>

At the end of this system, the response of this module can be monitored through the Node-Red Dashboard using the EMQX cloud. It is updated in real-time via WiFi and can be accessed by computer or mobile. For that, the MQTT Broker and Node-red should be connected correctly. I will provide all the details about that, along with the full code, in a future repo. <br>

Use this for free for educational purposes. If it is unclear, get my help. <br>
